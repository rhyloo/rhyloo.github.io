Para decirle a una chica en español que te gusta ella y te gustaría salir con ella en una cita, podrías decir: "Me gustas y me gustaría invitarte a ver una película o dar un paseo por el centro de la ciudad contigo."

Si quieres ser sutil, podrías intentar usar un enfoque más indirecto. Aquí hay algunas opciones:

    "¿Te gustaría hacer algo juntos algún día? Podríamos ver una película o dar un paseo por el centro de la ciudad."

    "¿Te apetecería hacer algo divertido el fin de semana? Tengo ganas de ver una buena película o dar un paseo por el centro."

    "¿Qué tal si hacemos algo distinto este fin de semana? Me encantaría invitarte a ver una película o a dar un paseo por el centro de la ciudad."
