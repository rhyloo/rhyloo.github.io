<p>
Hi, I'm Bastian, dad, hobby photographer, software developer, and
signal processing scientist in Germany.
</p>

<p>
Both photography and programming are about telling stories. Expressing
a complex algorithm in simple terms, or stunning vista in a compelling
picture. Finding order and simplicity in a chaotic scene or code base.
Therein lies the challenge and joy of life.

</p>

<p>
My doctoral work started with designing a pitch estimation algorithm
for voiced speech, but I soon realized that there already existed more
than enough algorithms. The real challenge of pitch estimation
therefore was finding good databases and visualizations and error
metrics for evaluating various algorithms. This lead to the
development of an audio-specific database, a custom batch processing
framework robust to scientific code running amok, and an interface
library for running Matlab code from Python, all released as Open
Source software.

<h3 id="sec-12-1"><a href="https://bastibe.github.io/Dissertation-Website/">Pitch of Voiced Speech in the Short-Time Fourier Transform: Algorithms, Ground Truths, and Evaluation Methods</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-1">
<p>
or <i>Speech has a Pitch, but what is Pitch Anyway?</i>
</p>

<p>
My dissertation started from the design of a pitch estimation algorithm, originally destined for quite a different task. Surprisingly, I found the true scientific challenge not the algorithm itself but how to evaluate its accuracy: Traditionally, pitch estimation algorithms are evaluated against a <i>ground truth</i> that is just assumed to be accurate. Pitch is a human perception, not a measurable, physical quantity. As it turns out, these ground truths are based on pitch estimation algorithms themselves, and often ones derived from laryngograph measurements instead of acoustic recordings, which are not ideal for the task. Furthermore, the error measures used for evaluating pitch estimation algorithms are woefully inadequate.
</p>

<p>
So I set out to design a better ground truth, which does not rely on a single pitch estimation algorithm, but a large number of them, and is based on acoustic recordings. This does not solve the categorical mismatch between an algorithm's estimate and a human perception, but at least it sidesteps the biases of any one algorithm and laryngographs.
</p>

<p>
With that, I conducted a huge comparison study between a very large number of pitch estimation algorithms and speech databases, and introduced a number of new evaluation methods. This study was unprecedented in the area of research, and produced a number of interesting results. Chiefly among them, that the differences between speech and noise databases used for evaluation far outweigh any minute differences between algorithms. In other words, a strong case of overfitting across the entire area of research.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the work was more about data science than signal processing. Regrettably, I was <a href="https://bastibe.de/2019-07-09-publish-or-perish.html">not able to publish</a> my results in journals.
