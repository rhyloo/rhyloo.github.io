## Template for recipes
I modified a template for write my own recipes, I am not a pro but
my brother likes my way of cooking, so I wanted to take notes about
what I make for preparing meals that he likes. All in a nice-looking
format.


I took a template from overleaf and I made some format changes,
languages, font, background and images, the author is Raphkebab, it is
under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license and this is the [original
template](https://es.overleaf.com/latex/templates/cooking-recipe-template/zcmdmwpnbctk).


{{< images templates "/images/recipe.png" >}}

- The background was not made for me I got it from an amazing [DnD template](https://es.overleaf.com/latex/templates/d-and-d-5e-latex-template/vmfdkjfhfynv),
I dont know where the creator got it. 
- I added two languages (english/spanish), there is not too much text but I guess that is
easier if you just have to change a number.
- Some modificaciones on time, I added an extra color.
- The font before the changes was the default yet I  like more the
monospace font so I changed it.
- Removed the header image.
- Added conditional syntaxes for display.
