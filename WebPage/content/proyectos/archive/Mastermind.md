## What is Mastermind?
It is a game board for two players, it born in the 70s.

The objetive is to guess the combination what the other player has thought.


## About the project
I made it in 2018 for a subject, programming, we had to learn about
arrays and this was the best way to understand them.

#### Notes
The image was generated with the [<ins>**Death
Generator**</ins>](https://github.com/foone/SierraDeathGenerator),
this creates GAME OVER/YOU DIED screens as seen in Sierra Online's SCI
engine, as well as lots of other fake videogame screenshots from many,
many games.
